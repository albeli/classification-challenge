# Spam Email Detection Notebook

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook is designed to demonstrate the process of building, evaluating, and comparing two machine learning models for the purpose of detecting spam emails. The models covered in this notebook are Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier. The notebook walks through the entire data science pipeline, including data preparation, model training, and evaluation, to provide insights into spam email detection.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (optional for visualizations)


### Running the Notebook
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the notebook.
3. Run `jupyter notebook` in your terminal.
4. Open the `Spam_Detector.ipynb` file in the Jupyter Notebook interface that opens in your browser.

## Notebook Contents
The notebook is structured as follows:

1. **Data Loading**: Reading the dataset and understanding its structure.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preparing the data for modeling, including splitting into training and testing sets, and feature scaling.
3. **Model Building**:
   - Logistic Regression Model: Building and training the model.
   - Random Forest Classifier: Building and training the model.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Comparing the models based on their accuracy scores and discussing their performances.
5. **Conclusion**: Summarizing the findings and providing recommendations.

## How to Use This Notebook
- **Educational Purpose**: Understand how to implement Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier in a real-world dataset for spam detection.
- **Template for Projects**: Use the notebook as a template or reference for similar classification tasks.
- **Experimentation**: Experiment with different model parameters, feature selection techniques, and evaluation metrics.
